# Belly Button Biodiversity Analysis

### In this assignment, I have created an interactive dashboard that explores the dataset for Belly Button Biodiversity.
### The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
### As this Dashboard contains many samples, you are able to update all plots when a new sample is selected
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part 1 - Top 10 OTUs found
I have created a horizontal bar chart that displays the top 10 OTUs found in a particular individual.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part 2 - Bacteria found
I have created a bubble chart that displays the Bacteria found per sample.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part 3 - Metadata
I have created a section which displays the individual's demographic information such as id, ethnicity, gender, age, etc.
